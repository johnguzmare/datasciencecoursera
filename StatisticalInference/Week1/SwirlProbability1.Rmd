In this lesson, we'll review basic ideas of probability, the study of quantifying the
 likelihood of particular events occurring. Note the similarity between the words probability
 and probably. Every time you use the latter word you're implying that an event is more likely
 than not to occur.

The first step in understanding probability is to see if you understand what outcomes of an
 experiment are possible. For instance, if you were rolling a single, fair die once, how many
 outcomes are possible?
 
```r
1: 4 
2: Too many 
3: 1 
4: 6 

Selection: 4
```

The probability of a particular outcome of an experiment is the ratio of the number of ways
 that outcome can occur to all possible outcomes of the experiment. Since there are 6 possible
 outcomes to the experiment of rolling a die, and we assume the die is fair, each outcome is
 equally likely. So what is the probability of rolling a 2?

```r
1: 1/3
2: 2/6
3: 1/6
4: 0

Selection: 3
```

What is the probability of rolling an even number?
```r
1: 0
2: 1
3: 1/2
4: 1/3

Selection: 3
```
Since the probability of a particular outcome or event E is the ratio of ways that E could
 occur to the number of all possible outcomes or events, the probability of E, denoted P(E), is
 always between 0 and 1. Impossible events have a probability of 0 (since they can't occur) and
 events that are certain to occur have a probability of 1.

If you're doing an experiment with n possible outcomes, say e1, e2, ..., en, then the sum of
 the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1. If all the outcomes are equally likely, as in the
 case of a fair die, then the probability of each is 1/n.

If A and B are two independent events then the probability of them both occurring is the
 product of the probabilities. P(A&B) = P(A) * P(B)

Suppose you rolled the fair die twice in succession. What is the probability of rolling two
 4's?
```r
1: 1/6
2: 2/6
3: 0
4: 1/36

Selection: 1
```
Now consider the experiment of rolling 2 dice, one red and one green. Assume the dice are fair
 and not loaded. How many distinct outcomes are possible?

Each of the dice has 6 ways to land, and their outcomes are independent of each other. Each way
 the red die lands can be paired with each way the green die lands. For instance, a "1" on the
 red dice can occur independently of any of the 6 outcomes of the green dice.
```r
1: 1
2: 11
3: 12
4: 36
```

If an event E can occur in more than one way and these ways are disjoint (mutually exclusive)
 then P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of each of the ways in which it can occur.

 Rolling these two dice, what's the probability of rolling a 10?

Since the highest possible dice roll is a '6', the only combinations which give '10' are 4+6
 and 5+5. The first occurs in two ways - red dice gets '4' and green gets '6' OR red gets '6'
 and green gets '4'.
 ```r
 Event 1 : 4+6 Dice1: 6 Dice2:6 Occurs:12 
 Event 2 : 6+4 Dice1: 6 Dice2:6 Occurs:12 
 Event 3 : 5+5 Dice1: 6 Dice2:6 Occurs:12 
 ```
 12+12+12 = 36 Because there are 36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal 1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36. Because E is composed of 3 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=3/36.

```r
1: 2/36
2: 3/36
3: 0
4: 1/6

Selection: 2
```

What sum is the most likely when rolling these two dice?


 The choice of '1' is impossible rolling two dice, and '2' and '12' each occur in only one
 possible way (snake-eyes and double 6's, respectively), so '7' and '9' are the only reasonable
 choices. To roll '7' you can use any number from '1' to '6', while '9' can only use outcomes of
 '3' and above.
```r
1: 7
2: 9
3: 2
4: 12
5: 1

Selection : 1
```
The probability of at least one of two events, A and B, occurring is the sum of their
 individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A&B).


It's easy to see why this is. Calculating P(A) and P(B) counts outcomes that are in both A and B twice,
 so they're overcounted. The probability of the intersection of the two events, denoted as A&B, must be
 subtracted from the sum.

Back to rolling two dice. Which expression represents the probability of rolling an even number or a
 number greater than 8?

The probability of rolling an even number is 1/2 or 18/36. There are 10 ways of rolling a number greater
 than '8' - 4 ways for rolling '9', 3 for '10', 2 for '11' and 1 for '12'. How big is the intersection
 between rolling an even number and those greater than '8'?
```r
1: (18+10-2)/36
2: (18+10)/36
3: (18+10-4)/36
4: (18+4-2)/36

Selection: 3
```
It follows that if A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive, i.e. only one of them can occur, 
then P(A U B) = P(A)+P(B) .


Which of the following expressions represents the probability of rolling a number greater than 10?
```r
1: (2+1)/36
2: (1+1)/36
3: (3+1)/36
4: (3+1-1)/36

Selection: 1
```
Use the answer to the previous question and the fact that the sum of all outcomes must sum to 1 to
 determine the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 10.


A deck of cards is a set of 52 cards, 4 suits of 13 cards each. There are two red suits, diamonds and
 hearts, and two black suits, spades and clubs. Each of the 13 cards in a suit has a value - an ace which
 is sometimes thought of as 1, a number from 2 to 10, and 3 face cards, king, queen, and jack. We've
 created a deck in R for you. Type 'deck' to see it now.
```r

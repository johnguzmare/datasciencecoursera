Practice Programming Assignment: swirl Lesson : basics of statistical inference.
=========================

In this lesson, we'll briefly introduce basics of statistical inference, the process of drawing
 conclusions "about a population using noisy statistical data where uncertainty must be
 accounted for". In other words, statistical inference lets scientists formulate conclusions
 from data and quantify the uncertainty arising from using incomplete data.


Which of the following would NOT be a source of bad data?

1: Selection bias
2: Small sample size
3: A poorly designed study
4: A randomly selected sample of population

Selection: 4

So with statistical inference we use data to draw general conclusions about a population. Which
 of the following would a scientist using statistical inference techniques consider a problem?

1: Our data sample is representative of the population
2: Our study has no bias and is well-designed
3: Contaminated data

Selection: 3

Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference in action?

1: Counting sheep
2: Determining a causative mechanism underlying a disease
3: Testing the effectiveness of a medical treatment
4: Estimating the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate

Selection: 1

 We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is a
 number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a
 population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an experiment. Deterministic
 processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random variables, produce
 additional random variables which have their own distributions. It's important to keep straight
 which distributions you're talking about.

 Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses "long run
 proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed repetitions." The
 second is Bayesian in which the probability estimate for a hypothesis is updated as additional
 evidence is acquired. Both flavors require an understanding of probability so that's what the
 next lessons will cover.

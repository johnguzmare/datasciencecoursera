# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Code Book

## Description

This code book indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and the resulting data fields in `tidy.txt`.

### Source Data

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The data files loaded and used to get the results:

* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from '1' to '30'. 

* 'test/test_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from '1' to '30'. 


## Identifiers

* `subject` - Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. Its values are six  (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

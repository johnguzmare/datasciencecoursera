Exploratory Graphs 
===========


Why do we use graphs in data analysis? Why do we use graphs in data analysis?
----

* To understand data properties
* To find patterns in data
* To suggest modeling strategies
* To "debug" analyses
* To communicate results

Characteristics of exploratory graphs Characteristics of exploratory graphs
---
* They are made quickly
* A large number are made
* The goal is for personal understanding
* Axes/legends are generally cleaned up (later)
* Color/size are primarily used for information

Air Pollution in the United States Air Pollution in the United States
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets national ambient air quality standards for
outdoor air pollution
For fine particle pollution (PM2.5), the "annual mean, averaged over 3 years" cannot exceed

Data on daily PM2.5 are available from the U.S. EPA web site
Question: Are there any counties in the U.S. that exceed that national standard for fine particle
pollution?

Data

Annual average PM2.5 averaged over the period 2008 through 2010

```r
pollution <- read.csv("data/avgpm25.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character",
 "factor", "numeric", "numeric"))
head(pollution)

## pm25 fips region longitude latitude
## 1 9.771 01003 east -87.75 30.59
## 2 9.994 01027 east -85.84 33.27
## 3 10.689 01033 east -87.73 34.73
## 4 11.337 01049 east -85.80 34.46
## 5 12.120 01055 east -86.03 34.02
## 6 10.828 01069 east -85.35 31.19

``` 


Do any counties exceed the standard of 12 Î¼g/m3 ?

```

## Load Data


```{r data}
library(dplyr)

NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

head(NEI)
head(SCC)

```

## Questions

You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

```{r plot1 , echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

## Group and chain data
NEIdf_Total <- tbl_df(NEI) %>%
select(Emissions,year) %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Prepare and Generate Plot 
png("plot1.png", width=480, height=480)

plot(NEIdf_Total, type = "o", main = "Total PM2.5 Emissions", xlab = "Year", ylab = "PM2.5 Emissions", pch = 19, col = "darkblue", lty = 5)

dev.off()
```

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

## Group filter and chain data 
NEIdf_Total_by_county <- tbl_df(NEI) %>%
filter(fips=="24510") %>%
select(Emissions,year) %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Prepare and Generate Plot 
png("plot2.png", width=480, height=480)

plot(NEIdf_Total_by_county, type = "o", main = "Total PM2.5 Emissions in the Baltimore City", xlab = "Year", ylab = "PM2.5 Emissions", pch = 19, col = "darkblue", lty = 5)

dev.off()

```

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

```{r plot3, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

## Group filter and chain data 
NEIdf_county_by_type <- tbl_df(NEI) %>%
filter(fips=="24510") %>%
select(Emissions,year,type) %>%
group_by(year,type) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Prepare and Generate Plot 
png("plot3.png", width=480, height=480)

qplot(year, sum_Emmisions, data = NEIdf_county_by_type, color = type, geom= "line")+ ggtitle("Total PM2.5 Emissions in Baltimore City by Source") + xlab("Year") + ylab("PM2.5 Emissions") + theme_bw()

dev.off()

```

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

```{r plot4, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

##  filter data 
SCC_subset_coal <- SCC[grepl("Coal" , SCC$Short.Name), ]
NEI_subset_coal <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCC_subset_coal$SCC, ] 

## Group and chain data     
NEI_coal <- select( NEI_subset_coal, Emissions, year, type) %>%
group_by(year,type) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Prepare and Generate Plot 
png("plot4.png", width=480, height=480)

ggplot(NEI_coal, aes(x = year, y = sum_Emmisions, fill =type)) + geom_bar(stat= "identity", width = .4) + xlab("year") + ylab("PM2.5 Emissions (Coal-Related)") + ggtitle("Total PM2.5 Emissions (coal combustion-related sources)")  + theme_bw()

dev.off()    
```

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

```{r plot5, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

## filter data 
SCC_subset_vehicles <- SCC[grepl("Vehicles" , SCC$EI.Sector), ]
NEI_subset_vehicles <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCC_subset_vehicles$SCC, ] 
    
## Group and chain data 
NEI_vehicles <- filter( NEI_subset_vehicles, fips=="24510") %>%
select(Emissions,year) %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Prepare and Generate Plot 
png("plot5.png", width=480, height=480)

plot(NEI_vehicles, type = "o", main = "Total PM2.5 Emissions from motor vehicle sources \n in the Baltimore City", xlab = "Year", ylab = "PM2.5 Emissions (motor vehicle sources)", pch = 19, col = "darkblue", lty = 5)

dev.off()
```

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

```{r plot6, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

## filter data 
SCC_subset_vehicles <- SCC[grepl("Vehicles" , SCC$EI.Sector), ]
NEI_subset_vehicles <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCC_subset_vehicles$SCC, ] 

## Group filter and chain data by fips
NEI_vehicles_baltimore <- filter( NEI_subset_vehicles, fips=="24510" ) %>%
mutate(city="Baltimore") %>%
select(city,Emissions,year) %>%
group_by(year,city) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Group filter and chain data by fips
NEI_vehicles_la <- filter( NEI_subset_vehicles, fips=="06037" ) %>%
mutate(city="Los Angeles County, California") %>%
select(city,Emissions,year) %>%
group_by(year,city) %>%
summarize(sum_Emmisions = sum(Emissions))

## Combine R Objects by Rows
NEI_bind_vehicles <- rbind(NEI_vehicles_baltimore,NEI_vehicles_la)

## Prepare and Generate Plot 
png("plot6.png", width=480, height=480)

ggplot(NEI_bind_vehicles,aes(year,sum_Emmisions)) + geom_point(colour="darkblue") + geom_line(colour="darkblue", linetype="dotted") + labs(title= "Total PM2.5 Emissions from motor vehicle sources \n in the Baltimore City vs Los Angeles County, California") + labs(y="Total PM2.5 Emissions") + facet_grid(.~city) + theme_bw()

dev.off()
```

## Making and Submitting Plots

For each plot you should

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
Create a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file. Only include the code for a single plot (i.e. 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 should only include code for producing 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐)
Upload the PNG file on the Assignment submission page
Copy and paste the R code from the corresponding R file into the text box at the appropriate point in the peer assessment.

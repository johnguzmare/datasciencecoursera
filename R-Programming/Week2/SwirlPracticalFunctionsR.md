Practical R Exercise in Swirl (Funtions)
==========================================

```r
| Let's try using a few basic functions just for fun. The Sys.Date() function returns a string
| representing today's date. Type Sys.Date() below and see what happens.

> 
> Sys.Date()
[1] "2017-06-08"
```
```r

| The mean() function takes a vector of numbers as input, and returns the average of all of the
| numbers in the input vector. Inputs to functions are often called arguments. Providing arguments
| to a function is also sometimes called passing arguments to that function. Arguments you want to
| pass to a function go inside the function's parentheses. Try passing the argument c(2, 4, 5) to
| the mean() function.

> 
> mean(c(2, 4, 5))
[1] 3.666667
```
```r
```
